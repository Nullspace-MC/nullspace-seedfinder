# Nullspace Seedfinder
These are the tools written to find a seed which meets the requirements of the Nullspace Minecraft server. The requirements are:
- For Minecraft versions 1.7 and 1.8
- Triple witch huts within 2k of the origin
- Quad witch huts within 32k of the origin
- Double ocean monuments within 32k of the origin
- A mushroom island, mesa, ice spikes and jungle within 2k of the origin

This was written using the [cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes) library, a Minecraft seedfinding library for C and C++.

## Warning
These tools are not intended for general use, and are not polished or well-documented. If you have similar seed requirements to those above, you can look through the seeds already found with these tools in [final_seeds.csv](https://github.com/Pineapplecake/nullspace-seedfinder/blob/master/seeds/final_seeds.csv) (No special biome requirements) or [best_seeds.csv](https://github.com/Pineapplecake/nullspace-seedfinder/blob/master/seeds/best_seeds.csv). (With biome requirements)
